# Introduction

This is an Arduino library for making a soap connection to an IHC controller
(IHC controller is a home automation controller made by LK)
The library has been made for ESP8266

The library implements:

* Authentication
* Get runtime values
* Set runtime values
* Notification when a resource changes. (Currently the library only support notification of boolean resources)

## Examples

See the examples folder.

For more infomation about this library and my other IHC projects look at

Here you can also find my dingswicth project that was made with the IHCSoapClient library. 

The IHCAlternative service view application - is an easy way to find resource ids:
